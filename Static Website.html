				<h3>Howdy Y'all! </h3>
				<p>
				<b>My name is Jesus Villarreal Jr,and I am an aspiring web developer/network technician seeking entry-level opportunities. I currently reside in South Texas. </b>
				</p>
				<p> I recently graduate from <a href="http://www.utrgv.edu/en-us/"> University of Texas Rio Grande Valley </a> with a bachelors in Computer Science. I also acquired several CompTIA certificates such as <b><font color="red">CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, and CompTIA A+</font></b>. I enjoy learning new subjects and creating applications using modern languages and frameworks. Every now and then I go to Technology Events to keep up with recent technology changes. Besides academics, I'am often be found playing board games and video games, or lifting weights & going to the nearest bike trail.
